# balance_dataset
    This code will downsample the dataset to easily-tune 
    a max radio of 1:3. Minimum samples per class is also easily-tune parameter.
    results/active-inactives_info.txt file generated will provide the class balance per target.
    results/class_balance.txt file will contain global information of dataset balance.
    This code will balance each target active-inactives radio, NOT just whole set.
